# Image url scraper
Handy little tool to scrape urls of images from google. 
- Demo app : https://share.streamlit.io/ankur-singh/image_scrapper

### Datasets:
I have already scrapped urls of some common animals. Each file has 180 urls (enough for training a image classifer using fastai).
You can find all the datasets [here](https://github.com/Ankur-singh/image_scrapper/tree/master/datasets).

### Usage:
- If you want very few image urls (<= 99), then you can simply use the [demo-app](https://share.streamlit.io/ankur-singh/image_scrapper).
- If want to more than 99 urls, you can refer [sample_usage notebook](https://github.com/Ankur-singh/image_scrapper/blob/master/sample_usage.ipynb).

**Note:** URLs are directly scrapped from google. Hence, the dataset may not be perfect and might require some cleaning.
